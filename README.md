##The data acquired
It came from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

##Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities:WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. The variables in data X and Y are measured in a form of sensor signals  measured with waist-mounted smartphone and activity type the subjects performed during recording respectively.

##Code
The code provided is the combination of all datasets (train and test) and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

##Tidy Data
In txt.format, consists of 180 observations and 68 columns.
