# Getting-and_Cleaning-Data
Data Science Project Requirement
This Repo contains following files:
*1. run_analysis.R
*2. Codebook.md
*3. tidyData.txt
*4. README.md

##The data acquired
It came from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

##Description
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities:WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. The variables in data X and Y are measured in a form of sensor signals  measured with waist-mounted smartphone and activity type the subjects performed during recording respectively.

##Code
The code provided is the combination of all datasets (train and test) and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

##Tidy Data
In txt.format, consists of 180 observations and 68 columns.

##Instructions
Downloading the data files and reading it to R.
Then create a R file called run_analysis.R to does:

1. Merge the train and test set into one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
